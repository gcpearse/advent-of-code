# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is a resource created by Eric Wastl and available at https://adventofcode.com.

Programming puzzles are released from 1st to 25th December each year, allowing users to test their programming skills. Challenges can be solved with any programming language chosen by the user.

## My Advent of Code Repository

All challenges have been completed in **```JavaScript```**. The raw data for each puzzle has been saved in a text file and parsed, rather than being hard coded.

### Contents

Instructions for each challenge are saved in **```instructions```** as markdown files..

Text files with raw data for each puzzle can be found in the **```data```** folder.

The **```utils```** folder contains utility functions that are exported into other files.

Puzzle solution files are ordered sequentially by release date. For example, ```01-part-01.js``` in ```advent-2022``` is the solution for the first part of the puzzle for 1st December 2022.
