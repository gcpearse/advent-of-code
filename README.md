# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is a resource created by Eric Wastl and available at https://adventofcode.com.

Programming puzzles are released from 1st to 25th December each year, allowing users to test their programming skills.

Challengers can be solved with any programming language chosen by the user.

## My Advent of Code Repository

I started working on Advent of Code as a side project in late 2022 to support my learning while on the Northcoders bootcamp.

All challenges have been completed in **JavaScript**. The raw data for each puzzle has been saved in a text file and parsed, rather than being hard coded.
